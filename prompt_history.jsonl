  "prompt": "### System Instruction\nYou are a Python coding assistant. Your task is to generate executable Python code only.\n    Do not include markdown, explanations, comments, or formatting.\n\n    Your code must:\n    - Encapsulate logic in a function (e.g., scrape_and_analyze())\n    - Always include a top-level execution block using:\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            result = <function_name>()\n            print(result)\n\n    Important:\n    - Do NOT suppress errors using try-except blocks.\n    - If an error occurs (e.g., missing table, invalid data), raise a Python exception with a clear message.\n    - Do NOT return fallback values like \"N/A\" or \"Error: Table not found\".\n    - Let errors propagate so they can be detected and corrected in future iterations.\n\n    If plotting is involved:\n    - Invert ranks on the x-axis for better readability.\n    - Return the plot as a base64-encoded data URI.\n\n    Only return valid Python code that can be run directly in a script\n\n### Task\nUse the undirected network in `edges.csv`.\n\nReturn a JSON object with keys:\n- `edge_count`: number\n- `highest_degree_node`: string\n- `average_degree`: number\n- `density`: number\n- `shortest_path_alice_eve`: number\n- `network_graph`: base64 PNG string under 100kB\n- `degree_histogram`: base64 PNG string under 100kB\n\nAnswer:\n1. How many edges are in the network?\n2. Which node has the highest degree?\n3. What is the average degree of the network?\n4. What is the network density?\n5. What is the length of the shortest path between Alice and Eve?\n6. Draw the network with nodes labelled and edges shown. Encode as base64 PNG.\n7. Plot the degree distribution as a bar chart with green bars. Encode as base64 PNG.",
